\section{Overview}

This course helps students to understand contemporary excitement and
fears about ``Big Data'' in a long historical context. Much is new about
the way corporations, governments, and individuals use massive
computational resources to search for patterns. But those who use big
data draw on legacies from well before the computer age for data
management, for structuring a complicated world into measurable
quantities.

\subsection{Course Themes}

We will trace the long history of big data through four parallel
strands:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The rise of massive systems of data collection by the government in
  the 19th century through institutions like the census and the
  military.
\item
  The attempts of American businesses to collect and use data to control
  their markets and their workers.
\item
  The turn to data by the sciences.
\item
  The development of computers from the 1940s on, and the ways that
  social forces shaped the development of computing.
\end{enumerate}

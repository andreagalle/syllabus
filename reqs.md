# Requirements

#### Classroom

You must complete all the readings for the course and attend class prepared to discuss them.

#### Response Posts to Blackboard

6 times in the semester, you will post a short *response* to one or more of the readings for that day on Blackboard.
These must be posted by 5pm the day *before* class meets so that your peers have time to read them.
You must also write 6 *responses* to your peer's posts.
Both posts and responses will be included as part of your participation grade.

#### Papers

You will write one 5 to 7 page papers for this class, based on the readings; no outside research is expected.

#### Archival Project

Mid-semester, we will take a trip to the university archives to look at some archival documents. You will write up a description of another document from elsewhere in the archives. This can take the form of a straightforward narration, or you can adapt the information 

#### Final Project

Final project assignments will be distributed in October, but you should start thinking early about which one you will want. It will consist of either 1) an 8-10 page paper in which you extend one of the weeks of the course with additional readings; or 2) a digital project in which you analyze a dataset created before the year 1994 using modern tools. In either case, you must discuss the project in advance with me.

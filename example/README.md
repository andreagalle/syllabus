# An example

In this directory are the sources for my syllabus from my Spring 2013 course at Rutgers University, New Brunswick: English 350: 596, "Author, Reader, Field." Run `sh install.sh` to copy over the framework files from the parent directory, then `make all`. Compare the results to mine: [syllabus.pdf](http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~ag978/arf/syllabus.pdf) and [(pasted into wordpress) syllabus.html](http://arf.blogs.rutgers.edu/syllabus).

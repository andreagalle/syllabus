# Requirements

Because this course aims to introduce methodologies which many students will not have encountered, the course does not require an article-length seminar paper. It rather seeks to lay the foundation for article- (or book-) length work that makes serious use of sociological theories and methods. There will be two shorter assignments: 

1. A critical essay, of conference-paper length (8â€“10 pp.), on one literary text or several texts, informed by sociological theory.
2. A presentation (20 mins.) of a pilot project, to be given in an end-of-term mini-conference. An initial draft, in the form of a 750-word long abstract, will be due ten days before the conference. The pilot project must *not* be limited to the interpretation of a "major" literary text. Instead, the presentation should demonstrate some preliminary work modeled on one of the literary-sociological approaches discussed in class, and it should point out directions for completing that work in a possible longer project.

Ungraded informal writing, in the form of contributions to a course blog that engages with the scholarly texts of the course, will also be assigned to students in the class on a rotating basis. At least two students will blog for each class. Students will be required to blog at least twice in the semester.

Students are also required to create a free [Zotero](http://zotero.org) account (if they do not already have one) to maintain a bibliography for their research in the course. Other bibliography databases are acceptable, but only Zotero users will be able to add easily to the course's shared bibliography at [www.zotero.org/groups/author_reader_field](http://www.zotero.org/groups/author_reader_field).

# Grading

\begin{center}
final = 0.45(essay) + 0.45(presentation) + 0.1(participation)
\end{center}

All components are graded out of 4.0. Scores greater than 3.5 correspond to the letter grade A (outstanding work), scores greater than 3.0 and less than or equal to 3.5 correspond to B+ (very good, some problems), and scores greater than 2.5 and less than or equal to 3.0 correspond to B. The participation score includes the blogging assignment.

# Blogging

Each week, two students will be assigned to write a response to the secondary readings assigned for that week, completing their postings by 5 p.m.\ on the Wednesday before we meet to discuss those readings. The rest of the class is required to read these postings before seminar.

The response can be informal, experimental, inconclusive, or polemical, strident, tendentious, or anywhere in between. It should be at least a couple of paragraphs. It can engage with primary texts (assigned or not) as well, but the main purpose of the blog is to think through the arguments and methods proposed by the sociology of literature as we are looking at it in this course. If this engagement occasionally happens via discussions of literary texts as well, so much the better; if it occasionally happens via lolcat, so much the better.

It is my hope that other students will comment on posts and add their own posts whenever inspiration strikes them, even on non-required weeks. But this is by no means an obligation.

As the major assignments near, students may find it helpful to incorporate their thinking about the critical paper or the conference presentation into blog posts.

The blog will be on the public internet. In order to safeguard student privacy, every student will choose a handle under which they will post and comment pseudonymously. It is important that students also use only these handles to refer to one another in the public space of the blog. If you wish to depseudonymize yourself, you may; remember that what you say will then be discoverable by a Google search for your name. You may also elect to explicitly designate a license under which your material is posted (for example: "All posts by ``SocIt2em`` are CC-BY-SA ``SocIt2em`` 2013"). In addition to copyright, consider the [Creative Commons licenses](http://creativecommons.org/choose/).
